Here is some of my work:

The SFU folder is the work I did for a C++ course which I got the highest score in.

The Java folder is from an android app I wrote last year for a high school planner app. 
However, the code is partial since it was all I could restore. Android apps have many other folders and code but it is not relevant since it was set up by the IDE. 
I could not recover any other work from any other android apps. 

I have worked with Python too but I could not find any of it.
